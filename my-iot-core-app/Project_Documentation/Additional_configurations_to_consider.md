1. **MQTT TLS Configuration:**  
   In device/device_simulator.py, you're connecting to AWS IoT Core on port 8883. AWS IoT requires a secure TLS connection. Youâ€™ll need to configure TLS by specifying the certificates and calling something like `client.tls_set()` before connecting.

2. **Endpoint Placeholder:**  
   The `AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT` remains as `"your-iot-endpoint.amazonaws.com"`. Be sure to replace this with your actual AWS IoT endpoint before publishing.


Overall, the project files and configuration appear sound aside from these improvements. Make sure to test the TLS connection and update credentials/endpoints accordingly.
